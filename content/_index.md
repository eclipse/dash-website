## What is the Eclipse Dash Project?

{{< incubation >}}

Project Dash is a place where the community itself can collaborate on tools for community awareness and collaboration in support of our ultimate objective of committer quality and cooperation. This is very much a research project as we are not entirely sure what these tools will be.

## Components

### Eclipse Project Handbook

This document provides you with the information that you need to create a new Eclipse open source project or become a committer on an existing one.

*   View [the handbook](/projects/handbook);
*   Clone [the repository](https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/admin/projects/dash/org.eclipse.dash.handbook) (via Gerrit); or
*   Report [an issue](https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/enter_bug.cgi?product=Dash&component=Handbook).

### Gently Dependency Scanner

**Coming soon!**

This is a collection of tools for rooting through content to determine dependencies, legal documentation conformance, etc.
